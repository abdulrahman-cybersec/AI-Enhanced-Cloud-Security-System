AI-Enhanced Cloud Security System for Real-Time Network Protection

Project Overview

This project presents an AI-enhanced cloud security system designed to monitor, analyze, and protect large-scale cloud network traffic in real time. The system uses machine learning techniques to automatically detect cyber threats, reduce false positives, and provide actionable security insights through real-time dashboards.

The project focuses on practical cybersecurity challenges in cloud environments and demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance traditional security mechanisms.

System Architecture

The system is composed of four main layers:

1. Traffic Monitoring Layer – Collects and processes simulated cloud network traffic


2. AI Analysis Layer – Applies machine learning models to detect anomalies and intrusions


3. Alert & Logging Layer – Generates real-time alerts and stores security logs


4. Visualization Layer – Displays system status, threats, and traffic patterns




---

How the System Works

1. Network traffic data is collected from multiple simulated cloud services


2. Features are extracted from traffic logs


3. AI models analyze the data to identify abnormal patterns


4. Detected threats trigger automated alerts


5. Results are visualized on a real-time dashboard for administrators




---

Attack Simulation

The system was tested using simulated cyberattacks, including:

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

Unauthorized access attempts

Malware injection scenarios


These simulations were used to evaluate detection accuracy and system reliability.
